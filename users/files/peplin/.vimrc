" first clear any existing autocommands:
autocmd!

" * User Interface

syntax on

" have fifty lines of command-line (etc) history:
set history=100

" remember all of these between sessions, but only 10 search terms; also
" remember info for 10 files, but never any on removable disks, don't remember
" marks in files, don't rehighlight old search patterns, and only save up to
" 100 lines of registers; including @10 in there should restrict input buffer
" but it causes an error for me:
set viminfo=/50,'50,r/mnt/zip,r/mnt/floppy,f0,h,\"100

" have command-line completion <Tab> (for filenames, help topics, option names)
" first list the available options and complete the longest common part, then
" have further <Tab>s cycle through the possibilities:
set wildmode=list:longest,full

" use "[RO]" for "[readonly]" to save space in the message line:
set shortmess+=r

" display the current mode and partially-typed commands in the status line:
set showmode
set showcmd

" don't have files trying to override this .vimrc:
set nomodeline

" * Text Formatting -- General

" don't make it look like there are line breaks where there aren't:
set nowrap

" use indents of 4 spaces, and have them copied down lines:
set shiftwidth=4
set tabstop=4
set shiftround
set expandtab
set autoindent

" normally don't automatically format `text' as it is typed, IE only do this
" with comments, at 80 characters:
set formatoptions-=t
set textwidth=80

" get rid of the default style of C comments, and define a style with two stars
" at the start of `middle' rows which (looks nicer and) avoids asterisks used
" for bullet lists being treated like C comments; then define a bullet list
" style for single stars (like already is for hyphens):
set comments+=fb:*

" treat lines starting with a quote mark as comments (for `Vim' files, such as
" this very one!), and colons as well so that reformatting usenet messages from
" `Tin' users works OK:
set comments+=b:\"

" * Text Formatting -- Specific File Formats

" enable filetype detection:
filetype on
filetype plugin on

" recognize anything at all with a .txt extension as being human-language text 
" [this clobbers the `help' filetype, but that doesn't seem to prevent help
" from working properly]:
augroup filetype
  autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.txt set filetype=human
augroup END

" in human-language files, automatically format everything at 72 chars:
autocmd FileType mail,human set wrap
autocmd FileType human set formatoptions +=t

autocmd FileType tex set wrap

" for C-like programming, have automatic indentation:
autocmd FileType c,cpp,slang,java set cindent

" for actual C (not C++) programming where comments have explicit end
" characters, if starting a new line in the middle of a comment automatically
" insert the comment leader characters:
autocmd FileType c set formatoptions+=ro

" for Perl programming, have things in braces indenting themselves:
autocmd FileType perl set smartindent

" for CSS, also have things in braces indented:
autocmd FileType css set smartindent

" for HTML, generally format text, but if a long line has been created leave it
" alone when editing:
autocmd FileType html set formatoptions+=tl

" in makefiles, don't expand tabs to spaces, since actual tab characters are
" needed, and have indentation at 8 chars to be sure that all indents are tabs
" (despite the mappings later):
autocmd FileType make set noexpandtab shiftwidth=8

autocmd FileType ruby set shiftwidth=2

" * Search & Replace

" make searches case-insensitive, unless they contain upper-case letters:
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" show the `best match so far' as search strings are typed:
set incsearch

" assume the /g flag on :s substitutions to replace all matches in a line:
set gdefault

" * Keystrokes -- Moving Around

" have the h and l cursor keys wrap between lines (like <Space> and <BkSpc> do
" by default), and ~ covert case over line breaks; also have the cursor keys
" wrap in insert mode:
set whichwrap=h,l,~,[,]

" scroll the window (but leaving the cursor in the same place) by a couple of
" lines up/down with <Ins>/<Del> (like in `Lynx'):
" [<Ins> by default is like i, and <Del> like x.]
noremap <Ins> 2<C-Y>
noremap <Del> 2<C-E>

" use <Ctrl>+N/<Ctrl>+P to cycle through files:
" [<Ctrl>+N by default is like j, and <Ctrl>+P like k.]
nnoremap <C-N> :next<CR>
nnoremap <C-P> :prev<CR>

" have % bounce between angled brackets, as well as t'other kinds:
set matchpairs+=<:>

" * Keystrokes -- Formatting

" have Q reformat the current paragraph (or selected text if there is any):
nnoremap Q gqap
vnoremap Q gq

" have the usual indentation keystrokes still work in visual mode:
" vnoremap <C-T> >
" vnoremap <C-D> <LT>
" vmap <Tab> <C-T>
" vmap <S-Tab> <C-D>

" have Y behave analogously to D and C rather than to dd and cc (which is
" already done by yy):
noremap Y y$

" * Keystrokes -- Toggles

" Keystrokes to toggle options are defined here.  They are all set to normal
" mode keystrokes beginning \t but some function keys (which won't work in all
" terminals) are also mapped.

" have \tp ("toggle paste") toggle paste on/off and report the change, and
" where possible also have <F4> do this both in normal and insert mode:
nnoremap \tp :set invpaste paste?<CR>
nmap <F4> \tp
imap <F4> <C-O>\tp
set pastetoggle=<F4>

" * Keystrokes -- Insert Mode

" allow <BkSpc> to delete line breaks, beyond the start of the current
" insertion, and over indentations:
" set backspace=eol,start,indent

" have <Tab> (and <Shift>+<Tab> where it works) change the level of
" indentation:
"inoremap <Tab> <C-T>
"inoremap <S-Tab> <C-D>
" [<Ctrl>+V <Tab> still inserts an actual tab character.]

" Set F2 and F3 to swap between hpp and cpp
map <F2> :e %:p:s,.h$,.X123X,:s,.cpp$,.h,:s,.X123X$,.cpp,<CR>
map <F3> :vsp %:p:s,.h$,.X123X,:s,.cpp$,.h,:s,.X123X$,.cpp,<CR>
